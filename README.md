# Optimization Problem

Included in this data set are multiple folders with different sets of knapsack data. The files look as such:

| line number | elem[0] | elem[1] |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | number of items | max weight allowed in the knapsack |
| 2 | value of item 1 | weight of item 1 |
| 3 | value of item 2 | weight of item 2 |
| 4 | value of item 3 | weight of item 3 |
| ... | ... | ... |
| x | value of item x | weight of item x |
  
Your response output should include:
- total value of knapsack
- time to run solution
- indexes of items selected
