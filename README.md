# Optimization Problem

Included in this data set are multiple folders with different sets of knapsack data. The files look as such:

lines
---
[1]    <number of items> <max weight allowed in the knapsack>
[2]    <value of item 1> <weight of item 1>
[3]    <value of item 2> <weight of item 2>
[4]    <value of item 3> <weight of item 3>
[5..x] <value of item 4..x> <weight of item 4..x>
  
Your response output should include:
- total value of knapsack
- time to run solution
- indexes of items selected
